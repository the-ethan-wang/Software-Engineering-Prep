# 🧭 Getting Started — Create Your GitHub Account & Run Your First Python Code

Welcome to your **first coding course using GitHub**! Follow these steps to get everything ready for your Python projects.

---

## 1️⃣ Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **Sign up** (top-right corner)
3. Choose:
   - A **username** you like (ensure it is school appropriate) OR if you already have an existing account, you can use that. 
   - Your **school email** (if possible)
   - A **strong password**
4. Verify your email address (check your inbox).

✅ Done — you now have your GitHub account!

Now come back this page for step 2.

## 2️⃣ Log in to GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based coding environment. It lets you code directly in the browser — no installs needed!

1. Click the green **“Code”** button, then **“Create codespace on main”**. OR click on the Codespace Badge.
   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/BaulkhamHillsHS/Software-Engineering-Prep?quickstart=1)
2. Wait for it to load — it might take a couple of minutes.
3. You’ll see a terminal at the bottom. This is your Python workspace. This is a fully functional Python IDE to complete this work.

---

## 3️⃣ Run your first Python program

In the terminal, type:

```bash
python 1_Printing_and_Variables.py
```

Then follow the prompt and see your output!

---

## 4️⃣ Save and Commit Your Work

Each time you finish a lab:
1. Click **Source Control** (the third icon on the left).
2. Write a short message like `finished 1_Printing_and_Variables`.
3. Click **Commit & Push**.

That saves your progress to GitHub automatically.

---

## 5️⃣ Next Steps

- Work through each folder in order.
- Ask for help if your codespace doesn’t open or you see errors.
- Keep your repo tidy — commit often, small steps.

Happy coding! 🐍
